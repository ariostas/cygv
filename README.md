# CYGV

:warning: **Important note** :warning: This project is in very early stages and currently offers no functionality. This message will be removed when it is at least partially working.

This project aims to implement an efficient algorithm to perform the HKTY procedure [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9308122)][[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9406055)] to compute Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) and Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants of Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds obtained as hypersurfaces or complete intersections in toric varieties. This project is based on the work presented the paper "[Computational Mirror Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00757)", but written in the Rust programming language and with some additional improvements.
