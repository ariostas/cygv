⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ This project is still in early stages. The code and documentation are under active development and may change significantly.

This project implements an efficient algorithm to perform the HKTY procedure [[1], [2]] to compute Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) and Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants of Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds obtained as hypersurfaces or complete intersections in toric varieties. This project is based on the work presented in the paper "[Computational Mirror Symmetry]", but written in the Rust programming language and with some additional improvements.
